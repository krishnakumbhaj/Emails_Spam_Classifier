Your requirements.txt covers most common packages for data science and NLP projects. However, here are a few suggestions:

1. Specify versions for reproducibility. For example:
            ```
            streamlit==1.32.2
            scikit-learn==1.4.2
            pandas==2.2.2
            numpy==1.26.4
            matplotlib==3.8.4
            seaborn==0.13.2
            nltk==3.8.1
            wordcloud==1.9.3
            xgboost==2.0.3
            scipy==1.13.0
            joblib==1.4.2
            pickle5==0.0.12
            ```

2. pickle5 is only needed for Python <3.8. If you use Python 3.8+, you can remove it.

3. If your code uses other libraries (like Flask, TensorFlow, etc.), add them.

4. Consider adding a comment at the top:
            ```
            # requirements.txt for Email_Spam project
            ```

Let me know if you want a version-pinned requirements.txt!
